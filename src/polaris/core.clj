(defn build-routes
  "Create routes that can be used with router. 

  A spec must be a vector of either

  [path-spec ident action-spec & specs*] or

  [path-spec action-spec] or

  [path-spec & specs*]


  path-spec is a string specifying the parent directory (by default
  \"/\") of nested specs. It may contain parameterizable sub-paths
  such as \"/home/profiles/:username/\". These can be resolved
  under :params in the request when it is passed to an action.

  Idents can used for reverse-routing (reverse-route). They must be
  keywords and are optional. Multiple idents for one route may be
  specified in a set instead of a single keyword. The same idents may
  be used exclusively in specs that have identical paths and reside on
  one level.

  action-spec is either:

  - a function that will be invoked for all requests that match the
    path

  - a namespace qualified symbol that will be resolved before this
    function returns. require will be invoked on its namespace

  - a var that can be resolved to a function at request time

  - a hash-map mapping request-methods to one of those


  Specs will be matched in the order they are provided, regardless of
  their hierachy level, unless they are on the same level and have the
  same path in which case their action-specs and idents are merged.
